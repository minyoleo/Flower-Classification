# Flower classification

### Task
Design and train a deep convolutional network to predict the class label of a flower image. 
Use a pre-trained model(ResNet50) and fine-tune it on the flower images.

### Data
* The dataset is collected by Alexander Mamaev.
* It contains 4,326 images in 5 classes, with about 800 images per class.
* A training set of 3896 images and a test set of 430 images are provided.

### Usage
```bash
cnn_ResNet50.ipynb
```
```bash
